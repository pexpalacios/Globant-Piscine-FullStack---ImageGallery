# Globant-Piscine-FullStack---ImageGallery

An online gallery using the Unsplash AP to get the images. A free account only llet's me do 50 request for hour, so can't do too much. Works with docker. Technically all the docker needs is submitted and all the other depencies get downloaded, but this is my literal first time doing it so I don't know how that'll go.

Notes to me:
- Need to check if it downloads everything at home
- This is a second repo bc I fucked up the firt one, that's why the first commit is so advanced
- Need to look into the dark mode (not working)
- Need to make the main content wrap well and that the sde bar goes from column to row in phone view
- Still need to do the OAuth implementation and favourites
- maybe, just maybe, look into how to put enough pics to fill the page
